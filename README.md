- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariohdz01. Just call me Mario!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new techincal skills and networking with people I can learn from. I love dogs, running, horror movies, reading and I sort of have a guilty pleasure for reality tv. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code and have recently completed a full stack java web development course. I'm interested in growing my knowledge further in Java, Javascript, React, Springboot and SQL. I also want to dip into learning Python, Go and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on unique ideas and projects. I love collaborating and team building!
- 📫 You can reach me by email at mariohdz01@hotmail.com or on Linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/mario-a-hernandez.
